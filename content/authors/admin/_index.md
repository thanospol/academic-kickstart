I am the VP of Scientific Computing and Head of the Radiomics R&D team with Q Bio, responsible for building technology that quantifies, digitizes, and simulates human physiology. From 2015 to 2018, I was an Assistant Professor with the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. I also held Postdoctoral Research Associate positions with the Laboratory of Electromagnetics and Acoustics at EPFL and the Computational Prototyping Group at MIT.
